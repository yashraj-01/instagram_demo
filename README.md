# instagram_demo

This is a simple and basic implementation of instagram app. I have used the Parse server(AWS) for storing the data. In this app you can create an account or login to your existing account, upload photos, view your and other users feed.

#update

My AWS acccount has expired so the parse server is currently not working.
